### 2024 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
If I'm being honest, for this project I went in blind in terms of design intention. My technical goals however, have always been clear to me. The only goal I have from the start is to essentially build my own pseudo 3D renderer in P5. By just rendering the normals of a 3D model as a .png image I can load the pixels into p5.js and by interpolating between the red and green channels it gives a pretty convincing lighting effect.
